# Usability & Accessibility

* Clear navigation bar with meaningful icons. These icons are sourced from the google icon libaray. They help to minimize the words on the navbar, while still stands out to enhance the understanding. 

* The profile page is horizontally aligned for big screen, and vertically aligned for small screen. So that both big screen users and small screen users can have the best customer experience. 

* Users can access the others' profile through many different ways, including: 
    * The search bar in the navigation bar 
    * The "author" tag in the posts  
    * Names in the "post like list" 
    * Names in the "comment list"  

* The post description text uses handwriting fonts from the google font libaray to provide a better reading experience. 

* When a user tries to log out, the website will confirm with the user using the modal window. 

* For adding a comment, there is no "comment submission button". The comment is submitted once the user presses the "Enter" key. The same applies to the navigation user search. 

* The website will continuously fetch new feed at the background. When there is new feed, the notification icon in the navigation bar will have a small "snooze alarm" icon next to it. So that the user can easily know that there is new feed. 

* When a user tries to submit the post without uploading an image, the modal window will alert the user and open the uploading window straight after the user closes the modal window.
